# ML-SENTIMENT-ANALYSIS

The goal of this project is to use the pre-trained Google Bert model to train a classifier on tweets from Twitter. The dataset has four classes: “Negative”, “Positive”, “Neutral”, and “Irrelevant”. Here is the sample of the data:

Following image show the frequency of each category in the dataset:

However, this model is very large and complex, and it would need access to a powerful GPU to train it. Therefore, I have not trained this model yet.
